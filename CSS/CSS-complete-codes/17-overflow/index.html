        <p>
          As I continue learning and experimenting with web development, I often
          create sections where the content grows larger than the visible area.
          Understanding how CSS overflow works helps me manage scrolling areas,
          hidden text, clipped elements, and neat container layouts. Whether
          I’m working on project dashboards, long descriptions, or UI cards,
          overflow plays a key role in controlling how content behaves inside a
          fixed-sized box. It keeps layouts clean, readable, and user-friendly,
          especially when handling dynamic or unpredictable data.

          As part of UI design, overflow handling becomes essential when dealing
          with long text, images, or auto-generated content. Learning how to
          control scrollbars, hide extra content, or show tooltips helps create
          cleaner and more polished interfaces.
